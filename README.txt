This Python project generates a melody using Context-Free Grammar (CFG) and saves it as a MIDI file
Libraries: Mido ("pip install mido" - in command prompt to get library)


How to use:
Download .py file 
Install at least version 3.X of python
Install Mido library
hit windows key
type "Command Prompt" press enter
assuming "C:\Users\username>"
type "CD Downloads" to navigate to downloads folder (or navigate to folder where music.py is located)
run "python music.py" in command prompt in directory where music.py was downloaded (downloads by default)
"melody.mid" will be created in same directory as python code is ran (downloads by default)
play "melody.mid" to hear randomly generated music
